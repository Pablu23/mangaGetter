# Custom Bato Manga loader

Have you ever had the Problem that the Panels on [Bato.to](https://bato.to) didn't load correctly? 

Well I have

That's, why I created this simple pre Loader, right now it's not really user-friendly, but I plan on at least adding 
a few more features

# Features that might get added:
- Manga / Chapter History
- Searchbar
- Better looking UI
- Main Screen

# Pretext

This Program is supposed to be a client for Bato and not a replacement site, this should be hosted on your local 
machine, maximum for your Lan, if you deploy it for your Lan you have the fortune (or misfortune) of having the same 
Chapter state on every device that connects to your server

# Known Problems
- Switching too fast from Chapter -> Chapter -> Chapter, can cause issues (But this is normally in the few seconds)
